#### HW10, Practice with metadata

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after deadline

I am consolidating documentation for all databases and data tables [here](https://github.com/pmean/introduction-to-sql/blob/master/data/all-data.md).

1.  Pick a database (any database). Use one of the approaches shown in the video to list all the table names. It is okay if the database that you chose has only one table.

2. Pick a table (any table). Use one of the approaches shown in the video to list all the field names.

3. Do an Google search on how to get table names in a database other than Oracle and SQLite. For example, do a Google search on "MySQL list table names".  Find a page that explains the process clearly and list the link to that page along with a brief description in your own words about how this works.

Submit your results in a single PDF file.

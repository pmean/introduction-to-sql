### Synopsis

There are eight modules in this class and a final exam. In each module (except the last one), you will participate in a discussion board, take a short quiz, and prepare a homework assignment.

Your first task is unofficial, but you need to decide how you will run SQL in this class.

There are at least three methods to access SQL, and they all have been tested by us. You can sign in to the Insights platform and use Oracle use SAS to send queries. You can run SQLite on your computer and use R to send queries. Or you can send queries to SQLite using SQLite Studio. The videos show you how to implement any of these approaches. You are welcome to try different approaches. One student used Python to access SQLite and another used SQLPro studio to access SQLite. Just be aware that we have not tested anything other than the three approaches listed above.

**It is VERY important for you to start the homework right away. About a quarter of the students in the class will have great difficulty successfully running even the simple program asked for in this module. It's not their fault. It is almost always some incompatibilities on their computer systems that need to get resolved. If you are having difficulty, talk to us now. If you wait, then you will fall far enough behind that you may not be able to catch up.**

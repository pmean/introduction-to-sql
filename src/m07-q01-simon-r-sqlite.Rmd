Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Note: Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [Hirotugu Akaike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirotugu_Akaike).

Q1. Count the number of records after an inner join of acupuncture_baseline_results and acupuncture_one_year_results. Count the number of records after a left join of acupuncture_baseline_results and acupuncture_one_year_results. Why are these numbers different?

```{r hirotugu_akaike}
library(sqldf)
akaike <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/melange.sqlite")
hirotugu_inner <- dbGetQuery(conn=akaike,  "
    select count(*) as n
      from acupuncture_baseline_results as b
      join acupuncture_one_year_results as o
      on b.id=o.id
")
hirotugu_inner
hirotugu_left <- dbGetQuery(conn=akaike,  "
    select count(*) as n
      from acupuncture_baseline_results as b
      left join acupuncture_one_year_results as o
      on b.id=o.id
")
hirotugu_left
dbDisconnect(conn=akaike)
```

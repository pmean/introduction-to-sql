Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Note: Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is  
[Helen Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_M._Walker).

Q7. In a previous question, you were asked to list the that were in acupuncture_baseline_results but not in acupuncture_one_year_results. Use the set operator “except” to achieve the same goal.

```{r helen_walker}
library(sqldf)
walker <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/melange.sqlite")
helen_q7 <- dbGetQuery(conn=walker,  "
    select id
      from acupuncture_baseline_results
    except
    select id
      from acupuncture_one_year_results
")

helen_q7
dbDisconnect(conn=walker)
```

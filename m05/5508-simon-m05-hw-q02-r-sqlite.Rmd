Purpose: To answer M04-Q02. Use the hospital table in the ehr database. The variable ACUTE_NONACUTE has the values Acute and Non-Acute. Use the substr function to convert these two values to the first letter (A or N). Print out the first ten values only.

Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [John Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey).

```{r john_tukey}
library(sqldf)

tukey <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/ehr.sqlite")

john <- dbGetQuery(conn=tukey, "
    select
      substr(ACUTE_NONACUTE, 1, 1) as single_letter_code
    from hospital
    limit 10
")

john
dbDisconnect(conn=tukey)
```

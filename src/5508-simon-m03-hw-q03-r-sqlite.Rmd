Purpose: Answer M03-Q03. There is only one hospital where the number of beds (BED_SIZE) is unknown. Find the id of that hospital

Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [David Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blackwell).

```{r david_blackwell}
library(sqldf)
blackwell <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/ehr.sqlite")
david <- dbGetQuery(conn=blackwell,  "
    select
      HOSP_ID
      from hospital
      where BED_SIZE is null
")
david
dbDisconnect(conn=blackwell)
```

+ Patient_type data dictionary
  + This data is a small selection of data from the Health Facts database. There is no private health information, but please do not share this data outside of this class.
  + If you are using Oracle, you need to specify
    + schema=ehr
  + If you are using SQLite, you need to download the file
    + hospital_db.SQLite from [this page](https://github.com/pmean/introduction-to-sql/blob/master/data/all-data.md).
  + You should not need this, but there is a [backup of the data in CSV format](https://github.com/pmean/introduction-to-sql/blob/master/data/patient_type.csv).
  + All of the data is stored in a single table named
    + patient_type
  + It has 12 records and 2 fields named
    + PAT_TYPE_ID
    + PAT_TYPE_DESC

### Synopsis

Thee where keyword allows you to limit the number of records retrieved by a database. You can restrict your query for the first few records, but the code is different for every SQL implementation. You can also restrict by a logical condition or by a partial match to a string.

This information is also available on [my github site][thisf].

If there is a discrepancy, the Canvas site takes precedence. The [readme.md file][mygit] on my github site has links to other important files for this class.

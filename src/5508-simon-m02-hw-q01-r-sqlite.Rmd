Purpose: Answer M02-Q01. Use table patient_type in EHR data mart. Order all the fields by 
Pat_type_desc and print just the first four rows from the table.

Note: To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians. The statistician being honored in this code is [Florence Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale).


```{r q1}
library(sqldf)
florence <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/ehr.sqlite")
nightingale <- dbGetQuery(conn=florence,
 "select *
    from patient_type
    order by Pat_type_desc
    limit 4")
nightingale
dbDisconnect(conn=florence)
```

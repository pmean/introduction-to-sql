Fat data dictionary

This dataset is described in an article published in
the Journal of Statistics Education about fitting 
percentage of body fat to simple body measurements.
The two key variables are measures of body fat, a 
rather complex assessment that requires weighing 
a person underwater. At the same time, researchers
collected simpler measures of circumference at the
neck, chest, abdomen, hip, thigh, knee, ankle, 
biceps, forearm, and wrist to see if the complex 
measure of body fat could be approximated by some 
combination of circumference measures.

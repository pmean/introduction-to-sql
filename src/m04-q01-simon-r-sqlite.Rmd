Purpose: To answer M04-Q01. Use the cigarettes table in the melange database. The variable weight_g is recorded to four decimal places. Round all the values to two decimal places and display them.

Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [John Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey).

```{r john_tukey}
library(sqldf)

tukey <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/melange.sqlite")

john <- dbGetQuery(conn=tukey, "
    select
      weight_g, round(weight_g, 2) as rounded_weight
    from cigarettes
")

john
dbDisconnect(conn=tukey)
```

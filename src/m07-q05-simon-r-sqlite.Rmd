Q5. Compute the intersection of the ids from acupuncture_baseline_results and acupuncture_one_year_results.

```{r helen_walker}
library(sqldf)
walker <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/melange.sqlite")
helen_q5 <- dbGetQuery(conn=walker,  "
    select id
      from acupuncture_baseline_results
    intersect
    select id
      from acupuncture_one_year_results
")

helen_q5
dbDisconnect(conn=walker)
```

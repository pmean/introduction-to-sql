Purpose: To answer M05-Q1. Use the encounter table in the ehr database. Classify age into two groups labelled 'Child' and 'Adult'. A child represents patients with age <= 20 and an adult represents patients with age >20. Hint: use the case function.

Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Note: Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [Barbara A. Bailar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_A._Bailar).

```{r barbara_bailar}
library(sqldf)
bailar <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/ehr.sqlite")
barbara <- dbGetQuery(conn=bailar,  "
  select 
    age,
    case 
      when age <= 20
        then 'Child'
        else 'Adult'
      end as age_group
  from encounter
  limit 20
")

barbara
dbDisconnect(conn=bailar)
```

# sql-and-r

This is a series of short programs using R Markdown. It 
requires the use of the RSQLite package.

It was run and tested using RStudio and the knitr package.

Use the file with the .Rmd extension as input, or examine the
file with the .html extension to see what the output is like.

There are several files with a sqlite extension. You can create
these files using input-files.Rmd or you can download them
from my github site.

This application does not need any special files beyond the
ones listed above.

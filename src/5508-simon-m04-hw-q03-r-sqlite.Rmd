Purpose: To answer M04-Q03. Use the titanic table in the melange database. Run a query that counts the number of male and female children (Age <= 18)

Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [George W. Snedecor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Snedecor).

```{r george_snedecor}
library(sqldf)
snedecor <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/melange.sqlite")
george <- dbGetQuery(conn=snedecor,  "
  select sex, count(*) as number_of_children
    from titanic
    where age < 18
    group by sex
")

george
dbDisconnect(conn=snedecor)
```

Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Your homework

+ Round the value 29.526 to two decimal places.
+ Truncate the value 29.526 to zero decimal places.
+ Calculate the remainder of the value 2500 after it is divided by 500
+ Put your code and output in a single pdf file

Note: Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [John Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey).

```{r john_tukey}
library(sqldf)
tukey <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/hospital.sqlite")
john <- dbGetQuery(conn=tukey,  "
    select
      round(29.526, 2) as rounded_value,
      round(29.526, 0) as truncated_value,
      mod(2500, 500) as remainder
")

john
dbDisconnect(conn=tukey)
```

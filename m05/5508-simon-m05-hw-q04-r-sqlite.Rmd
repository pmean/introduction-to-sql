Purpose: To answer M04-Q04. Use the titanic table in the melange database. Run a query that identifies the ages of the youngest and oldest patients in each passenger class.

Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Note: Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [George W. Snedecor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Snedecor).

```{r george_snedecor1}
library(sqldf)
snedecor <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/melange.sqlite")
george <- dbGetQuery(conn=snedecor,  "
  select 
    PClass,
  	min(Age) as youngest,
	  max(Age) as oldest
  from titanic
  group by PClass
")

george
dbDisconnect(conn=snedecor)
```

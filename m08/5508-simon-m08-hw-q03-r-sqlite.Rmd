Purpose: Answer Homework questions from module06

This solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available. 

Note: Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [Robert V. Hogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_V._Hogg).

3. Get a count of the numbers of males and females where you restrict age to be less than 40. Use the label for sex, but convert it to all uppercase.

```{r robert_hogg}
library(sqldf)
hogg <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/melange.sqlite")
robert <- dbGetQuery(conn=hogg,  "
    select 
        upper(s.sex_label) as sex,
        count(*) as n
      from acupuncture_demographics as d
      join acupuncture_sex_labels as s
        on d.sex=s.sex_code
      where age < 40
      group by d.sex
")
robert

dbDisconnect(conn=hogg)
```

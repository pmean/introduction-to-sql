#### HW01, Practice using the SELECT statement

Graded: 3 point, one point deduction if submitted after the due date.

M01-Q01. Use patient_type table in EHR Datamart. Oracle users do not need to download anything, but do need to use schema=ehr in their code. Read all the fields and all 12 records from this table.

M01-Q02. Use the table crawling. Oracle users do not need to download anything, but do need to use schema=melange in their code. Run a query that changes Temperature to Temperature_F and displays all three fields and all records.

Refer to [this page][git1] for a description of the data files and where you can download them. Convert your code and results for both queries into PDF files and combine them, if you can into a single PDF file.

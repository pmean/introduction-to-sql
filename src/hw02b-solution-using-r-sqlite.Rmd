This file was created on 2020-01-31 and last modified on `r Sys.Date()`.

Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Use patient_type table in EHR Datamart. Refer to the page "Data used in this module" for a description of the data and where you can download it. Oracle users do not need to download anything.

1. Read all fields and  all records
2. Change Pat_type_desc to Patient_Type_Desc
3. Put your code and the output in a single PDF file

Note: Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [Gertrude Mary Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Mary_Cox).


```{r}
library(sqldf)
cox <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/patient_type.sqlite")
gertrude <- dbGetQuery(conn=cox,  "
    select
      pat_type_id, 
      Pat_type_desc as Patient_Type_Desc
      from patient_type
")

gertrude
dbDisconnect(conn=cox)
```

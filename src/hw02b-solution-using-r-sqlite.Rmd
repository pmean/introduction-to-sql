Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Use patient_type table in EHR Datamart. Refer to the page "Data used in this module" for a description of the data and where you can download it. Oracle users do not need to download anything.

1. Read all fields and  all records
2. Change Pat_type_desc to Patient_Type_Desc
3. Put your code and the output in a single PDF file

```{r}
library(sqldf)
db <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/patient_db.sqlite")
patient_data <- dbGetQuery(conn=db,  
"select
  PAT_TYPE_ID, 
  Pat_type_desc as Patient_Type_Desc
  from patient_crawling_table")

crawling_data
dbDisconnect(conn=db)
```

1. Use patient_type table in EHR Datamart. Refer to the page "Data used in this module" for a description of the data and where you can download it. Oracle users do not need to download anything, but do need to use schema=ehr in their code. Read all the fields and all the records from this table.

2. Use the table crawling. Refer to the page "Data used in this module" for a description of the data and where you can download it.

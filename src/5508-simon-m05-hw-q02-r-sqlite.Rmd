Purpose: Answer M05-Q2. Use the hospital table in the ehr database. Convert null values of teaching_ind to -1 and print the values only for  census_reg = "West". Hint: Use coalesce function.

Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Note: Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [Barbara A. Bailar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_A._Bailar).

```{r barbara_bailar}
library(sqldf)
bailar <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/ehr.sqlite")
barbara <- dbGetQuery(conn=bailar,  "
  select 
    teaching_ind,
    coalesce(teaching_ind, -1) as imputed_value
  from hospital
  where census_reg='West'
")

barbara
dbDisconnect(conn=bailar)
```

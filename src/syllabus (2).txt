**Common Questions about Course Details**

Catalog Course ID 	
  MEDB 5508-0001 (45837)

How many Credit Hours will I receive after successfully completing this course?	
  2

What are the Meeting Times and Location for the course?	
  This is an online class with no pre-specified meeting times.

What is the format of this course?	
  Asynchronous online.

What is this course about (Course Description)?	 
  SQL (Structured Query Language) is the primary language responsible for managing data and data structures contained within a relational database management system (RDBMS). Put simply, SQL is the language we use to interact with a database. A working knowledge of SQL is a vital skill for anyone involved in quantitative research.

What are the knowledge, skills or perspectives (Student Learning Outcomes) that I will gain from the course?	
  This course will introduce retrieving data using the SQL SELECT Statement, restricting and sorting data, reporting aggregated data using the group functions, displaying data from multiple tables, write subqueries and more through hands-on exercises. Students will develop the fundamental skills needed in retrieving, sorting, aggregating and displaying datasets using Structured Query Language (SQL).

Are there Pre-requisites/Co-requisites that are key to my success in this course?	
  This course will provide a working familiarity with SQL. Students are not expected to have advanced programming or statistical analysis skills. A basic understanding of statistical terminology and a working familiarity with computer-based data files (e.g., Excel) is necessary. The class will introduce basic methods for SQL (Structured Query Language). This class will not cover database administration, installation, and configuration but will provide you with a firm foundation to address these areas in your advanced classes or in your research efforts, including thesis/dissertation research.

**General Policies for UMKC Courses**

Will I be dropped from class if I not attend class?  What happens if I do not attend class without communicating with my instructor?
  Maintaining accurate enrollment records throughout the term is a partnership between instructors and students.  Instructors are responsible for verifying student attendance and participation within the first three weeks (16 week course) through the Attendance Verification Survey (administered through UMKC Connect) as well as maintain records of participation throughout the term so that the last date of attendance for students with recorded "F" or "W" final grades may be submitted.  Because student plans for enrollment sometimes change prior to the semester start, students not engaging in courses through the initial weeks of each course may be administratively dropped.  For more detailed information regarding the policy, [click here](https://catalog.umkc.edu/undergraduate-academic-regulations-information/registration/administrative-drop-policy/)

How do I get permission before recording class sessions?
  Instructor(s) may record class sessions for the sole purpose of sharing the recording with students who can't attend class. Instructor(s) will take care not to disclose personally identifiable information from the student education records during the recorded lesson. Students are not permitted to record class sessions without written consent from the course instructor.

Is there Recommended Technology that I should have access to?
  You will need access to the computing resources necessary to complete this course through personal and/or University channels (e.g., computer labs). Our course will take place within the Canvas LMS and utilizing various software technologies that facilitate interaction and communication. We can make alternate arrangements should your reason for being without computer access warrant an accommodation (note: travel for vacation/work does not necessitate accommodations).  Below is a list of some helpful computer requirements for full participation in this online class: the latest version of Java; the latest version of QuickTime; the latest version of Adobe Reader; a current version of word processing software or a text editing program; a headset with microphone; a webcam; Google Chrome, Firefox, or Edge for Windows computers; Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari for Apple computers. Broadband Internet connection is preferred. Examples of broadband Internet connection are high-speed DSL or a Cable modem.

**Specific Information about this class**

Required and Recommended Materials	
  There is NO required textbook for this class. A recommended textbook is Learning SQL- Master SQL Fundamentals, By Alan Beaulieu Publisher: O'Reilly Media. Dr. Simon and Suman Sahil have copies of this book and students may review by appointment. Online tutorials include [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) (this may be used as a step by step tutorial or you as a reference to learn more about a specific SQL command), [SQL Tutorial](http://www.sqltutorial.org/) (this site organizes the SQL commands into groups for easy review).

Course Expectations, Course Policies, Requirements and Standards for Student Coursework and Student Behavior
  You are expected to do your homework independently. You can seek help from your instructors, from colleagues, or from the Internet to help decode an error message that you don't understand. You can adapt code that you find on the Internet. We recommend that you acknowledge the source for that code in the comments of your program, but this is not required.

Evaluation and Grading
  Students will be required to post messages on the Canvas discussion boards, take brief quizzes on Canvas, and submit homework assignments in PDF format on Canvas. Your work is due on the specified date. We need to keep the class on the same time schedule for a variety of reasons. If illness, family issues, work responsibilities, or other commitments prevent you from completing on time, please contact one of the instructors before the due date. Late submission without prior notice will receive a one point deduction. If you find yourself repeatedly falling behind on quizzes and assignments, it would be good to set up a videoconfernce with one or both of us to discuss this.

  This course is grade Credit/No Credit (Pass/Fail). Students who complete at least 80% of the regular coursework and score at least 80% on the final exam will receive credit for the course.

Final Exam
  Your final exam will be posted on Canvas on December 4, 2020 and needs to be completed prior to December 18, 2020.

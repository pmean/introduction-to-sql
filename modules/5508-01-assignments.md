#### Discuss01

Graded: 3 points, 1 point deduction if late.

Please briefly introduce yourself. Tell us a bit about yourself professionally, and optionally tell us one thing that is not related to your work or your career. Also optional, but greatly appreciated, would be a picture of yourself.

#### HW01, Practice using the SELECT statement

Graded: 3 point, one point deduction if submitted after the due date.

M01-Q01. Use patient_type table in EHR datamart. Read all the fields and all 12 records from this table.

M01-Q02. Use the crawling table in the melange datamart. Run a query that changes Temperature to Temperature_F and displays all three fields and all records.

Refer to [this page][git1] for a description of the data files. Note that Oracle users need to use schema=ehr for M01-Q01 and schema=melange for M01-Q02. SQLite users need to download ehr.SQLite and melange.SQLite and place them in their data subfolder. 

Convert your code and results for both queries into PDF files and combine them, if you can into a single PDF file.

#### Quiz01

Please review the videos in this module before taking this quiz.

1. What symbol is used with the select keyword to select all fields in a table?

2. What symbol is used to separate field names in a query that selects more than one field?

3. What keyword is used to change the name of a field?

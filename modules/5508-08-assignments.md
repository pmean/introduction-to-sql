#### HW08, Practice with statistical summaries

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after deadline

I am consolidating documentation for all databases and data tables [here](https://github.com/pmean/introduction-to-sql/blob/master/data/all-data.md).

Run a query to count the number of passengers with the title "Mr" somewhere in their name.

Run a query that counts the number of male and female children (Age <= 18)

Run a query that identifies the ages of the youngest and oldest patients in each passenger class.

The Survived field has values of 0 (died) and 1 (alive) and an average of this value provides a probability of survival. Calculate this probability for six categories representing the combination of passenger class and sex. Include only those groups where the survival probability is greater than 30%.

Place the SQL code and the results of all your queries in a single PDF file.

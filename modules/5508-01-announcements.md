#### To be posted at the start of the class

Hello everyone!

It is our great pleasure to welcome you to Medical Bioinformatics 5508 0001 Intro to SQL this semester. I just want to say hello and share a few information for our Week 1 Module.

By now, you must be familiar with Canvas. The best starting point for MEDB 5508 is to visit the Week 1 Module01, Start Here page, in the Modules section of our canvas site. It lays out contact information, course overview, technology support, and configuring remote desktop access for running SQL.

If you have any questions or comments, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us (email: sumans@umkc.edu, simons@umkc.edu).

It is not too late for others to join the class. If you know of someone who would enjoy learning about SQL, please recommend this class to them and they should be okay if they sign up sometime during the first week or two of the class.

Welcome on board. Look forward to working with you.

#### Also to be posted at the start of class.

No class is perfect, but the nice thing about an asynchronous online class is that each semester, you can make it a little bit better. There aren't any major changes in store, but here are some minor tweaks and improvements.

1. Modules released automatically. Last time we taught this class, we had to release modules manually, and if things got busy, we might be late with this. Canvas has a nice automation feature that allows you to prespecify when a module becomes available. You will see a new module every week, more or less.

2. Removed old announcements. Most of the announcements that were carried over from last semester had information on module release dates and homework due dates that were no longer relevant for this semester. So I deleted almost all of them. You'll need fewer announcements because of the automation noted above, but we may need to send out a few announcements from time to time.

3. Answers to the homework released automatically. Once you submit a homework assignment, you will gain access to the SQL code that we used for this assignment. There will be one set of answers for those using SAS and Oracle and another set of answers for those using R and SQLite. There are other options, of course, such as using SQLite Studio, but you should be able to figure out how things work from the answers that we posted. We don't have this for every single homework assignment, but we do have it for the most important assignments.

4. Simplification and standardization of databases. We feel it is VERY IMPORTANT to give students access to SQL both through Oracle and through SQLite, but this caused problems when some of the database tables differed slightly between the two versions. This is harder to fix than you think, but we are hopefully getting the two systems aligned better. If you notice any inconsistencies, please tell us about them.

5. More simplifications. The SQLite databases were organized a bit haphazardly last semester. Now we are storing all data tables in one of two locations. The database melange.SQLite has all the tables created by Steve Simon and the database ehr.SQLite has all the tables created by Suman Sahil. The handouts and homework may refer to the old database names, but we will try to update these in the next few days. If you are using Oracle, you do not need to download anything, but you need to specify either schema=melange or schema=ehr in your code.

6. Better documentation. The database tables were inconsistently documented and we will be producing a more standardized description of each table.

All of these changes should make things a bit easier for you, compared to students in earlier semesters, but there is always the possibility for an increase rather than a decrease in confusion. If you have any difficulties, please contact us quickly, and we will try to resolve things expeditiously.

#### If students have problems

It's 5:30am and I can't sleep so I decide to get up and look at the discussion boards on Canvas that I have been neglecting for the past few days. It looks like some of you are having problems with getting basic access. Bummer! Sorry that I did not look at this sooner.

If you are having problems, here are some steps that you can take.

1. Recognize that the first step is often the hardest. I struggle myself getting new software to work, and I've been doing this for 40 years.

2. It's okay to experiment a little bit. If something doesn't work, try a small change. Don't do this forever, but tinkering for an hour or so is not bad. Tinkering is fun, actually. Once you get to the point, though, where it seems more frustrating than fun, talk to us.

3. Take a screenshot. Screenshots are not the best way to document what you did, but they are fast and easy and almost always work. There is a snipping tool on Windows system, and I'm sure there is something comparable on the Mac and Linux. Sometimes screenshots are hard to read. It may help to resize the window that you are taking a screenshot of, though not all windows are resizable. Sometimes changing the resolution of your monitor can help as well. It's really great on your eyes to set your monitor to 1920 by 1280 pixels or higher, but sometimes a screenshot looks better at a lower resolution like 1028 by 768. If you have scroll bars on the window you are taking a screenshot of, make sure that you scroll to the most important region, or take several screenshots of several different regions.

4. Make sure that you look at the very first error message. When something goes wrong with a computer program, a cascade of error messages will appear. More often than not, it is the first of these error messages that is most important.

5. If you show us an error message, show us the code that you wrote as well. Of course, some problems (such as with basic access) may appear before you've even written a single line of code, so we don't expect to see your code in those cases.

6. Let us know what you system you are using. Start with your computer. Is it a Windows system, a Macintosh, or some variation of Linux. Let us know what version of the Windows, Mac, or Linux system you are using. Are you using a system that is hardwired to the UMKC network (an office computer) or are you working remotely? Include any other details you think are important, but if you leave out an important detail, don't worry. We'll ask about anything we think might be relevant.

7. We can often fix things via the discussion board or email, but sometimes a live demonstration of the problem is needed. During the current COVID-19 crisis, a face-to-face visit is not often possible, but we can set up a Zoom videoconference, if needed, and let you share your screen so we can watch you as you recreate the problem.

Finally, and most importantly, be patient with us. The computer hardware and software that we are asked to help with comes in all different flavors. We want to help you no matter what, but the extreme heterogeneity that we face can be daunting at times. We'll figure it out, but sometimes it will take more than one attempt.

P.S. Asking for help on a programming assignment from someone other than your teachers is okay.. You are expected to do your own work in this class. You don't let other people write your programs. But it is okay to ask a classmate or a colleague to help troubleshoot an error message that you are getting. Make sure that you are the one who implements the suggestions that you get and everything will be fine.

#### To be posted at 25% mark

At the beginning of the semester, I am somewhat lenient in allowing late assignments. This is mostly because about a quarter of the students in any class will have trouble getting ANY access to SQL early on. Everybody should have access by now,  so I will start enforcing penalties for late assignments, starting with Module08. I will also put in zeros for any assignment which is more than two weeks late. That can be changed if you get the work submitted, but talk to me or Suman about this and let us know why you are so far behind in your work.

Both Suman and I are available for a Zoom video conference if you need a bit of help on any assignment.

To help me track progress, I have put zeros in for assignments that have not been done for anything due before [date]. That would be up to and including Module [xx]. Don't panic, though. If you submit something late, it can still be graded. 

If you are missing more than two or three assignments, however, you should talk to me as soon as possible. There are limits to what can be turned in late, especially as the semester will soon be drawing to a close.

Every time we teach this class, we introduce small improvements. This sometimes includes improvements to the homework assignments. Unfortunately, this can sometimes cause confusion, such as when the Panopto video from a couple of years ago refers to a slightly different version of your homework assignment. if there is a discrepancy between what a video describes as your homework and what you see on the Canvas site, please rely on the Canvas site. This discrepancy is especially notable in Module07, but you may see inconsistencies in any Module.

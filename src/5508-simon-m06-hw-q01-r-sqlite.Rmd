Purpose: Answer Homework questions from module06

This solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available. 

Note: Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [Robert V. Hogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_V._Hogg).

Use the same database shown in the video. It is available on the Insights platform, or you can download a sqlite file from Canvas.

1. List id and migraine_label for the first ten records after joining the acupuncture_demographics and acupuncture_migraine_labels.

```{r robert_hogg}
library(sqldf)
hogg <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/melange.sqlite")
robert <- dbGetQuery(conn=hogg,  "
    select d.id, m.migraine_label
      from acupuncture_demographics as d
      join acupuncture_migraine_labels as m
      on d.migraine=m.migraine_code
      limit 10
")
robert

dbDisconnect(conn=hogg)
```

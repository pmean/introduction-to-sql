Purpose: Answer M03-Q01. Verify that the hospital id code (HOSP_ID) has no missing values.

Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [David Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blackwell).

```{r david_blackwell}
library(sqldf)
blackwell <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/ehr.sqlite")
david <- dbGetQuery(conn=blackwell,  "
    select
      count(*) as number_missing_ids
    from hospital
    where HOSP_ID is null
")

david
dbDisconnect(conn=blackwell)
```

Note: this solution uses R and Oracle. An alternate solution using SAS and SQLite is also available.

Use patient_type table in EHR Datamart. Refer to the page "Data used in this module" for a description of the data and where you can download it. Oracle users do not need to download anything, but do need to use schema=ehr in their code. Read all the fields and all the records from this table.

Note: Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [Gertrude Mary Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Mary_Cox).


```{r}
library(sqldf)
# install.packages('RJDBC')
library(RJDBC)

drv=JDBC("oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver",classPath="C:/oracle/ojdbc6.jar")

cox <- dbConnect(
  drv, 
  "jdbc:oracle:thin:@//kc-chi-hfprod.kc.umkc.edu:1521/chihfprd.world", 
  "simons",
  "Sunday19")

gertrude <- dbGetQuery(conn=cox,
  "select * 
   from hospital")
   
gertrude
dbDisconnect(conn=db)

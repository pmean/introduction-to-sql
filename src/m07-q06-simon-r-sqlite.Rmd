Q6. Compute the union of the ids from acupuncture_baseline_results and acupuncture_one_year_results.

```{r helen_walker}
library(sqldf)
walker <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/melange.sqlite")
helen_q6 <- dbGetQuery(conn=walker,  "
    select id
      from acupuncture_baseline_results
    union
    select id
      from acupuncture_one_year_results
    order by id
")

helen_q6
dbDisconnect(conn=walker)
```

#### HW06, Practice with retrieving data from multiple tables

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after deadline

M06-Q01. Use the various acupuncture tables. List id and migraine_label for the first ten records after joining the acupuncture_results_table and acupuncture_migraine_table.

M06-Q02. Get a count of the number of records in the database in the control group and the treatment group from the acupuncture_demographics table. Use the label for group (found in the acupuncture_group_labels table) and not the number code.

M06-Q03. Get a count of the numbers of males and females (from the acupuncture_demographics table) where you restrict age to be less than 40. Use the label for sex (from the acupuncture_sex_labels table), but convert it to all uppercase.

Put your code and the output in a single PDF file.

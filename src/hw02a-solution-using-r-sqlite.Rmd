This file was created on 2020-01-31 and last modified on `r Sys.Date()`.

Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Use the database crawling_db. Refer to the page "Data used in this module" for a description of the data and where you can download it. Oracle users do not need to download anything.

1. Read all three fields and all records
2. Change Temperature to Temperature_F
3. Put your code and the output in a single PDF file

Note: Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [William Edwards Deming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming).

```{r}
library(sqldf)
deming <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/crawling_db.sqlite")

edwards <- dbGetQuery(conn=deming, "
    select
      Birth_month,
      Temperature as Temperature_F,
      avg_crawling_age
      from crawling_table
")

edwards

dbDisconnect(conn=deming)
```

Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Note: Some of the names used in this code are arbitrary and you can choose whatever names you want. To emphasize which names can be modified at your discretion, I am using names of famous statisticians.

The statistician being honored in this code is [Hirotugu Akaike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirotugu_Akaike).


Q3. Display all the pk1 values for patients 64 and older.

```{r hirotugu_akaike5}
library(sqldf)
akaike <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/melange.sqlite")
hirotugu_q3 <- dbGetQuery(conn=akaike,  "
    select 
      d.id, d.age, b.pk1
      from acupuncture_demographics as d
      inner join acupuncture_baseline_results as b
      on d.id=b.id
      where d.age >= 64
")

hirotugu_q3
dbDisconnect(conn=akaike)
```

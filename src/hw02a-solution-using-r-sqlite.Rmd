Note: this solution uses R and SQLite. An alternate solution using SAS and Oracle is also available.

Use the database crawling_db. Refer to the page "Data used in this module" for a description of the data and where you can download it. Oracle users do not need to download anything.

1. Read all three fields and all records
2. Change Temperature to Temperature_F
3. Put your code and the output in a single PDF file

```{r}
library(sqldf)
db <- dbConnect(SQLite(),
  dbname="../data/crawling_db.sqlite")
crawling_data <- dbGetQuery(conn=db,  
"select
  Birth_month,
  Temperature as Temperature_F,
  avg_crawling_age
  from crawling_table")

crawling_data
dbDisconnect(conn=db)
```

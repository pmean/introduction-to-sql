Fat data dictionary

This file has 252 rows and 19 variables. The two key variables are measures of body fat, a rather complex assessment that requires weighing a person underwater. At the same time, researchers collected simpler measures of circumference at the neck, chest, abdomen, hip, thigh, knee, ankle, biceps, forearm, and wrist to see if the complex measure of body fat could be approximated by some combination of circumference measures.

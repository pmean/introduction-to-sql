#### HW06, Practice with null values

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after deadline

2021-02-22. Special note for SQLite users. If you downloaded the file ehr.SQLite (Links to an external site.) earlier than this date, please download it again.

I am consolidating documentation for all databases and data tables [here](https://github.com/pmean/introduction-to-sql/blob/master/data/all-data.md).

Verify that the hospital id code (HOSP_ID) has no missing values.

There are only two fields in the database that have null values. Get a count of the number of missing values for the indicator for teaching hospital (TEACHING_IND).

There is only one hospital where the number of beds (BED_SIZE) is unknown. Find the id of that hospital.

Combine your results into a single PDF file and submit it.

#### Quiz06

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted late.

Please create a single PDF file that includes both our questions and your answers to the following.

1. Why does the code "where age=NULL" fail to produce any records?

2. What codes are NULL values converted to in SAS?

3. How do the statistical summary functions like AVG and COUNT handle missing values?

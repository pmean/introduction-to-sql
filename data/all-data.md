There are two major databases, ehr and melange. If you are using Oracle, you do not need to download anything, but you should use schema=ehr or schema=melange in your code. if you are using SQLite, then you need to download

+ [ehr.SQLite](https://github.com/pmean/introduction-to-sql/blob/master/data/ehr.SQLite), and
+ [melange.SQLite](https://github.com/pmean/introduction-to-sql/blob/master/data/melange.SQLite)

Here are the tables that you will find in ehr and melange. The links will take you to the appropriate data dictionaries.
